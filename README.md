# MODX
MODX (read “modex”) is a free, professional content management system (CMS) and web application framework designed to enable and organize the collaborative process of creating, editing and managing content (that is, content) of websites.

MODX is distributed free of charge under the GPL open source license. This means that the MODX system can be used by everyone: both for personal use and for commercial distribution of sites built on this management system.

MODX is written in the PHP programming language and uses the MySQL or MS SQL DBMS to store data. The MODX control system can be installed on most web servers (for example, IIS, Apache, Lighttpd, nginx and Zeus), and the system control panel (or admin area) works in almost all modern browsers.
